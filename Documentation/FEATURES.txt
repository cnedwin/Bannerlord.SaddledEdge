- issue with perk selection in the character screen not being saved on pressing Done. Disabling the mod restores this game functionality.
- issue with text input popup being slightly misaligned, making it difficult to edit records beneath the one currently changed.
- Issue where navigating any list of records using keyboard keys(eg. pressing L to jump to L named NPCs) only works for currently visible records.
- suggestion to remove character brother from the list of companions as he's in no way important after the initial training scene.
- suggestion to make it so the PC stays at the top of the list when ordering NPCs.
- suggestion to allow using CTRL+A inside text boxes.
- suggestion to remove the random string from the name box of all the records that can be renamed. Not sure what exactly it's used for, maybe localization?
- suggestion to lock in visible character traits so they never get affected by our ingame actions.
